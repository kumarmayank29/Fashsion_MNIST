### Fashsion_MNIST

We will use Fashion MNIST Dataset.It consists of 28*28 Gray Scale images.It has same number of sample ie 60000.How is it different from MNIST.Instead of handwritten images there are images of different types of clothing like we have images of T-shirts ,pants ,boots,shoes ,Sandles etc.

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is proposed as a more challenging replacement dataset for the MNIST dataset.

It is a dataset comprised of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, and more. The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below.

0: T-shirt/top
1: Trouser
2: Pullover
3: Dress
4: Coat
5: Sandal
6: Shirt
7: Sneaker
8: Bag
9: Ankle boot
It is a more challenging classification problem than MNIST 

The dataset already has a well-defined train and test dataset that we can use
